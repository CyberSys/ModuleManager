# Module Manager :: Change Log

* 2017-0506: 2.7.6 (sarbian) for KSP 1.3
	+ KSP 1.3 changes (#66)
		- Add names to dialog windows
		- Now required
			- Adjust MMPatchLoaderIndex
		- A new LoadingSystem was added at the beginning (FontLoader).  This
	+ change ensures that MM will always be after the GameDatabase regardless.
			- Fix position of MM info in loading screen
		- Things seem to have moved
			- Remove unused field
			- Press Alt+F11 again to dismiss the menu
		- Apparently this wasn't a feature before (at least not recently) but
	+ pretty simple to implement
	+ Reload PartUpgrade System after patching (#70)
	+ As the part-upgrade data is initially populated prior to ModuleManager
	+ patching, this fix allows for the patches that are applied to the
	+ PARTUPGRADE nodes to be reloaded for use by the PartUpgrade system.
	+ With this fix in place the tech-nodes, names, descriptions, etc, for the
	+ part-upgrade parts located on the tech tree will use the proper
	+ post-patching config data.
		- This solution has been tested to work properly when used directly from
	+ a ModuleManagerPostLoad callback.
		- Fix for problems discovered in KSP-RO/RealismOverhaul/#1628
	+ Temp revert of 1.3 changes to release a 1.2 patch

* 2014-0504: 2.0.9 (Swamp-Ig) for KSP 0.23.5
	+ So I've done my own enhancements to module manager.
	+ They seem to work pretty nice!  I'd really appreciate ppl testing it out on their various MM files prior to me pushing it back to the MM repo.
	+ Any issues you have - take them up with me not with sarbian
	+ Features:
	+ Order Preserving
		- now preserves the original order, both for nodes and for values.
	+ Use of NEEDS
```
PART:NEEDS[RealFuels] {
    name = dummyPartIgnore
    module = Part
    DOG {
        name = First
        key1:NEEDS[ProceduralParts|StretchySRB] = Original Value
        key2:NEEDS[!RealFuels] = Some other value
    }
}
```
	+ In the above, the part will only be defined if you have RealFuels loaded. You can do this on keys, values, patches, anywhere.
	+ key1 will be defined if (ProceduralParts OR StretchySRB are loaded) and RealFuels is NOT loaded.  You can still use , and it is treated like &. Not has highest precedence, then or, then and.
	+ Define an insertion point for any nodes or values
```
@PART[dummyPartIgnore]
{
    DOG {
        name = AddLast
        string = Will insert at the end
    }
    DOG,0 {
        name = AddFirst
        string = Will insert at the beginning
    }
    @DOG,0 { // Edits node zero as before, but ends up editing the above node
        string,0 = Insert before the string already at the beginning
    }          
}
```
	+ The index after the comma is where it will be inserted, this is relative to other nodes or values with the same name.
	+ Regexp replaces
```
@PART[dummyPartIgnore]
{
    @DOG[First] 
    {
        @string ^= :^.*$:First dog edit $& in place
    }
}
```
	+ Breaking this down, the first character defines the separator, the section between the first : and the second : is the match string, and the section following the second : is the replacement.
	+ For details on how to use regexp [see the documentation here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hs600312%28v=vs.110%29.aspx)
